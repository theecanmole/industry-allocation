# Free emissions units under the emissions trading scheme?

### Industrial allocation of free emissions units to industry 2010 to 2020

What is Industrial Allocation under the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme?

The Ministry for the Environment says [Allocations of New Zealand Units are given to businesses carrying out certain activities](https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/ets/participating-in-the-nz-ets/overview-industrial-allocation/).
  
I prefer what Motu Research say. That one (out of five) ways of allocating emissions units in an emissions trading scheme is industrial allocation which Motu define as [Receiving them for free](https://www.motu.nz/assets/Documents/our-research/environment/climate-change-mitigation/emissions-trading/A-Guide-to-the-New-Zealand-Emissions-Trading-System-2018-Motu-Research.pdf)

I have posted in detail about industrial allocation to [New Zealand Steel](https://rwmjohnson.blogspot.com/search/label/New%20Zealand%20Steel) and to [New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited](https://rwmjohnson.blogspot.com/search/label/NZ%20Aluminium%20Smelters)

However, I want to look at [Industrial Allocation](https://www.epa.govt.nz/industry-areas/emissions-trading-scheme/industrial-allocations/) in the round. How many emissions units have been given away since 2010? Is it a big number?

The Environmental Protection Authority annually publish the [final allocation](https://www.epa.govt.nz/industry-areas/emissions-trading-scheme/industrial-allocations/decisions/) of emissions units. So some analysis can be done.

How many units? The answer is fifty five million or 55,001,914 emissions units have been given away from 2010 to 2020.

This bar plot shows the 55 million emissions units year by year.
